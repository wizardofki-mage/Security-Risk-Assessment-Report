## Author
- Jason Ash, Computer Science Major

## Technologies
I'm currently pursuing an online Cybersecurity Certification through Coursera/Google. I created this security assessment report in LibreOffice and saved it as a PDF, resulting in a format that is more WYSIWYG for viewers. It can be viewed in any Web browser that can view PDF files or in Adobe Acrobat Reader.

## Explaination
- I wrote the security-hardening recommendations in Parts 1 and 2 based on the fictional scenario provided in the course assignment prompt.
- The Scenario section included is largely unaltered from the assignment prompt.
- Although this is a fictional scenario, the recommendations in my report are applicable to the real world and could be used in part by any organization to improve its cybersecurity posture.

## Room for improvement
As I learn more about cybersecurity, I could revisit and improve this report.

## Release date
28 December 2025

## Acknowledgements
The background scenario information is from the assignment prompt and largely unaltered. I wrote the recommendations in Parts 1 and 2.
